Hey there! Read below for installation guide.

1. Install JSONReader, config, program.cs, and all the commands.
2. Upload all files into IDE of choice (VS22 Personal Recommendation)
3. Make a folder for JSONReader and config.json named config for maintainability purposes.
4. Seperate commands also into a seperate file.
5. Head over to config.json, where it says token, in the speechmarks after the colon, delete the text and paste YOUR bot token.
-> To change the prefix, change the . in the speech marks to waht u like.
6. Now start the bot up!


Any concerns can be to @imisyy on discord!
